# Crontab

Hi, i want to show you how can we use crontab in linux. It's make a timer for executable file in linux

Sometimes you need run file more than once but you wouldn't always run manually because could be happened busy time for you. 

Here crontab comes into play, just you have to do, add **crontab job** your executable file.

You can check all crontab jobs ;

```sh
crontab -l 
```
