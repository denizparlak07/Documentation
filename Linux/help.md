# Help in Linux

Hi, we will look help in linux, it's a first step to start linux & unix. 

You don't know all the command in linux but you should know how to get help. There is a multiple choice if you need get help
- man
- help
- apropos

All of these make a similar job some of them explain too much details, some of them don't. 

If you know the command but no idea of the parameters, you are in the right place. Just you need use the help commands

For example imagene the chancing permission command **chmod**. You want to change directory and sub directory in same time 

so we can use **--help** or **man**

```sh
chmod --help

```
